# Cryptocurrencies
## Short Summary
In this project, I created an unsupervised machine learning model to analyze various cryptocurrencies. Unsupervised learning was helpful for this project, as I didn't know what relationship between the data I was looking for before starting my analysis. By reducing the data dimensions using PCA, I was able to create a K-means model that had a more manageable number of dimensions from my clean DataFrame. From there, I used the hvplot and ploty libraries to create tables and charts that help visualize what relationships the model has found. I was especially excited about the 3-dimensional plot I was able to create using hvplot, as it is a good representation of the relationship between multiple dimensions, and was helpful when looking at clusters that were fairly close together from a 2-dimensional perspective.
